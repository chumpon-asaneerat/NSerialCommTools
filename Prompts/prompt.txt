## Current Session Status (2025-10-21)

### Completed Work

âœ… **Protocol Analyzer Complete UI Design** (06-Protocol-Analyzer-Complete-UI.md)
- Full application layout designed using TabControl architecture (4 tabs: Input, Analysis, Field Editor, Export)
- Input tab uses sub-buttons to switch between Serial Port and Log File modes
- All UI components documented with C# implementation code
- SerialPortReader class implementation for real-time capture
- Field Editor with validation for C# identifiers
- Export functionality with JSON, YAML, Report, and Test Cases support
- Complete data models and workflow diagram (Mermaid flowchart)
- MainWindow integration showing event handlers and data flow

### Current Focus

This session focused on UI design and application architecture for the Protocol Analyzer tool.
The TabControl-based layout was selected per user feedback: "You use too much panel why not use tabcontrol to seperate input type"

### Files Created/Modified

1. **06-Protocol-Analyzer-Complete-UI.md** - Comprehensive unified application design (1700+ lines)
   - Merged previous 06 and 08 UI design files into single cohesive design
   - Field Editor directly updates exported definition (real-time preview)
   - All components share LogData and ProtocolDefinition objects

### Completed Design Sections

1. **Main Application Window Layout**
   - Toolbar with New, Open, Save, Export buttons
   - TabControl with 4 main tabs
   - Status bar showing message count, confidence, validation status

2. **Input Tab (with sub-modes)**
   - Serial Port Mode: Port/Baud settings, connection status, live capture display
   - Log File Mode: File browser, format detection, preview panel
   - Navigation buttons between tabs

3. **Analysis Tab**
   - Protocol type detection (Single-line, Multi-line, Command-response)
   - Terminator analysis with confidence bar
   - Delimiter analysis with frequency table
   - Fields detected list
   - Overall confidence score

4. **Field Editor Tab**
   - Editable data grid (Pos, Current Name, New Name, Type, Sample)
   - Selected field details panel
   - Live JSON definition preview
   - Validation buttons (Suggest Names, Validate, Undo, Redo)

5. **Export Tab**
   - Validation status with checkmarks
   - Export configuration (device name, output folder)
   - Format selection (JSON, YAML, Analysis Report, Test Cases)
   - Export/Save/Exit buttons

### Next Session TODO

1. **Implement Protocol Analyzer UI in WPF**
   - Build MainWindow layout based on design
   - Implement TabControl with 4 tabs
   - Create UserControl for each panel (Input, Analysis, FieldEditor, Export)
   - Wire up event handlers for data flow

2. **Implement Parsing Algorithms**
   - Use algorithms from 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md
   - PatternAnalyzer class for message boundary detection
   - DelimiterDetector for field delimiter analysis
   - FieldClassifier for data type inference

3. **Test with Real Device Logs**
   - Use log files from Documents/LuckyTex Devices folder
   - Validate analysis results match expected protocols

4. **Create Protocol Definition Exporter**
   - JSON export (ProtocolDefinition object)
   - YAML export
   - Analysis report (TXT format)
   - Test cases (JSON format)

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **TabControl** for workflow stages (not separate panels)
- **Observable pattern** for real-time data binding
- **Shared data model** (LogData, AnalysisResult, ProtocolDefinition) across all tabs
- **Validation before export** ensures data integrity
- **Live preview** of field definitions as user edits

### Technical Notes

- SerialPort class supports connection pooling via USB-to-Serial adapters
- Field validation checks for C# identifier rules (no keywords, unique names, valid chars)
- Confidence scoring (0-1) for all detections
- Export supports multiple formats for different use cases

**Session Summary**: Completed comprehensive Protocol Analyzer UI design with TabControl architecture. Ready for WPF implementation in next session.
