- Last Sesion
refer to 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md (the previous file which heavy depend on my production code) 
I told that you should think that you dont know anything beforehand so just pure datastructure and 
algorithm can be used. After that you create 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis_New.md but session reach limit 
before i ask question so check both documents and tell me Are new documents cover State Machine Parser?

Also for make more precision let find the examples log data from another devices (let reduce scope only 
weight machine that you can find information on web by hardware producer) please give me another 5 devices 
and create new folder ExtraDevices and let keep each device information you found in each sub folder which 
shoud each sub folder should contains
- origin.md (summary information (Device Name/Model) with source/link) 
- log_data.txt (MUST Have the log data prefer in HEX/Text format)
