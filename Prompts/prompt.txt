- Last Sesion

** NOTE: The Generate Files should be large (over 1000 lines) make sure you use proper tool to update/recreate file ** 

refer to 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md (the previous file which heavy depend on my production code) 
I told that you should think that you dont know anything beforehand so just pure datastructure and 
algorithm can be used. After that you create 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis_New.md but session reach limit 
before i ask question so check both documents and tell me 
- Why you not keep HEX log data in document (i prefer to see HEX/Text and HEX only instead of Text only 
because as i told you before that not all protocols use CR-LF as terminator or seperator)
- Are State Machine Parser no need anymore or the ContentBased can cover all case?
- If it still need are new documents cover State Machine Parser?
- Can each Algorithms has diagrams that i can see i visually (the text description shoud stay in document)

## Completed in Previous Sessions

âœ… **Parsing Strategy Document (03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md)**
- Fixed all Mermaid diagram syntax errors
- Algorithm 4 restructured with clear step-by-step explanations
- State Machine diagram fixed (removed special characters causing parser errors)
- All 5 algorithm diagrams now rendering correctly
- Document is ready for use

## Focus for Next Sessions

1. **Update Protocol Analyzer UI** (02-Protocol-Analyzer-Tool.md)
   - Add serial port reading support (port selection, baud rate config, real-time capture)
   - Design should support both:
     - Reading from log files (existing)
     - Direct reading from serial ports (new)

2. **Code Implementation** (if needed)
   - Implement parsing algorithms in NLib.Serial.Devices
   - Test against real device protocols from Documents/LuckyTex Devices folder

NOTE: ExtraDevices folder and 15-device research task removed (cannot guarantee actual real device protocols without verified sources)
