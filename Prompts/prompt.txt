- Last Sesion
refer to 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md (the previous file which heavy depend on my production code) 
I told that you should think that you dont know anything beforehand so just pure datastructure and 
algorithm can be used. After that you create 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis_New.md but session reach limit 
before i ask question so check both documents and tell me 
- Are State Machine Parser no need anymore or the ContentBased can cover all case?
- If it still need are new documents cover State Machine Parser?
- Can each Algorithms has diagrams that i can see i visually (the text description shoud stay in document)

Also for make more precision let find the examples log data from another devices (let reduce scope only 
weight machine, pH meter machine, yardlage counter machine that you can find information on web by hardware producer)
please give me another 5 devices pre machine type (15 difference protocols)
and create new folder ExtraDevices and let keep each device information you found in each sub folder which 
shoud each sub folder should contains
- origin.md (summary information (Device Name/Model) with source/link) 
- log_data.txt (MUST Have the log data prefer in HEX/Text format) 


As for UI (Protocol Analyzer) if we can supports both read log file and direct read serial ports must be nice.

let create update tracker to make sure that when session reach limit we can continue in another session.
