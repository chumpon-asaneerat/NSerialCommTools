## Current Session Status (2025-10-21)

### Completed Work

✅ **Protocol Analyzer Complete UI Design** (06-Protocol-Analyzer-Complete-UI.md)
- Full application layout designed using TabControl architecture (4 tabs: Input, Analysis, Field Editor, Export)
- Input tab uses sub-buttons to switch between Serial Port and Log File modes
- All UI components documented with C# implementation code
- SerialPortReader class implementation for real-time capture
- Field Editor with validation for C# identifiers
- Export functionality with JSON, YAML, Report, and Test Cases support
- Complete data models and workflow diagram (Mermaid flowchart)
- MainWindow integration showing event handlers and data flow

### Current Focus

This session focused on UI design and application architecture for the Protocol Analyzer tool.
The TabControl-based layout was selected per user feedback: "You use too much panel why not use tabcontrol to seperate input type"

### Files Created/Modified

1. **06-Protocol-Analyzer-Complete-UI.md** - Comprehensive unified application design (1700+ lines)
   - Merged previous 06 and 08 UI design files into single cohesive design
   - Field Editor directly updates exported definition (real-time preview)
   - All components share LogData and ProtocolDefinition objects

### Completed Design Sections

**✅ UI SIMPLIFIED - NO TOOLBAR**

1. **Main Application Window Layout**
   - ❌ REMOVED: Toolbar (was: [New] [Open Log] [Import] [Save] [Export] [Settings] [Help] [About])
   - ✅ TabControl with 4 main tabs (primary navigation)
   - ✅ Status bar showing message count, confidence, validation status
   - Minimal, clean UI focused on workflow tabs

2. **Input Tab (with sub-modes)**
   - Serial Port Mode: Port/Baud settings, connection status, live capture display
   - Log File Mode: File browser with [Browse...] button, format detection, preview panel
   - ❌ REMOVED: Separate toolbar [Open Log] button (moved to Input Tab)
   - ❌ REMOVED: [Import] from toolbar (will add button only to Log File mode if needed later)
   - Navigation buttons: [◀ Back] [▶ Next: Analyze]

3. **Analysis Tab**
   - Protocol type detection (Single-line, Multi-line, Command-response)
   - Terminator analysis with confidence bar
   - Delimiter analysis with frequency table
   - Fields detected list
   - Overall confidence score
   - Navigation buttons: [◀ Back] [▶ Next: Edit Fields]

4. **Field Editor Tab**
   - Editable data grid (Pos, Current Name, New Name, Type, Sample)
   - Selected field details panel
   - Live JSON definition preview
   - Validation buttons (Suggest Names, Validate, Undo, Redo)
   - Navigation buttons: [◀ Back] [▶ Next: Export]

5. **Export Tab**
   - Validation status with checkmarks
   - Export configuration (device name, output folder)
   - Format selection (JSON, YAML, Analysis Report, Test Cases)
   - Export buttons: [◀ Back] [▶ Export] [Save Draft] [Exit]
   - ❌ REMOVED: Redundant toolbar [Export] button (moved to Export Tab)

### Settings & Configuration

- ❌ NO Settings dialog - settings configured manually each time
- ❌ NO Help or About dialogs
- ❌ NO Save Settings persistence
- Serial port settings configured in Input Tab each session
- Export folder selected manually in Export Tab each session

### Next Session TODO

1. **Implement Protocol Analyzer UI in WPF**
   - Build MainWindow layout based on design
   - Implement TabControl with 4 tabs
   - Create UserControl for each panel (Input, Analysis, FieldEditor, Export)
   - Wire up event handlers for data flow

2. **Implement Parsing Algorithms**
   - Use algorithms from 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md
   - PatternAnalyzer class for message boundary detection
   - DelimiterDetector for field delimiter analysis
   - FieldClassifier for data type inference

3. **Test with Real Device Logs**
   - Use log files from Documents/LuckyTex Devices folder
   - Validate analysis results match expected protocols

4. **Create Protocol Definition Exporter**
   - JSON export (ProtocolDefinition object)
   - YAML export
   - Analysis report (TXT format)
   - Test cases (JSON format)

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **NO Toolbar** - Minimal UI, all functions through TabControl tabs and in-tab buttons
- **TabControl** for workflow stages (Input → Analysis → Field Editor → Export)
- **Observable pattern** for real-time data binding
- **Shared data model** (LogData, AnalysisResult, ProtocolDefinition) across all tabs
- **Validation before export** ensures data integrity
- **Live preview** of field definitions as user edits
- **Manual configuration** - No persistent settings, users configure ports/paths each session
- **Tab navigation** via [◀ Back] [▶ Next] buttons (no toolbar navigation)

### Technical Notes

- SerialPort class supports connection pooling via USB-to-Serial adapters
- Field validation checks for C# identifier rules (no keywords, unique names, valid chars)
- Confidence scoring (0-1) for all detections
- Export supports multiple formats for different use cases
