- Update documents
We add 2 new devices TScaleNHB and TScaleQHW please check @Documents folder and 
update related files to make documents up to date.


- In @Documents\LuckyTex Devices\ folder we have hex log files that gets from capture device data 
I want some kind of analysis C# code that i can extract infomration from log files and make it 
in some type of definition scripts/flows and when new device added we work with this definition to 
work on actual devices/terminals what do you think is that posible?
