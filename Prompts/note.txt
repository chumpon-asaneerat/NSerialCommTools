Problem with last session.

**** Q1
- When switch to Analyze tab it show nothing? "Parse Packages" button is disable. 
  The packages : 0 show on screen. Why?

**** Q2
- From code Implemetation when you generate code i see you check documents and todo and found some topics not match 
  then you thiking that Phase 4 is about:

  ----------------
  1. Taking the log entries that were loaded in Phase 3 (LogDataPage)
  2. Using the DetectionConfiguration that was auto-detected (start/end markers, segment separator)
  3. SPLITTING the raw data into Packages (using markers)
  4. SPLITTING each package into Segments (using separator)
  5. DISPLAYING them in a UI

  This is about PARSING/SPLITTING, not statistical analysis. 
  The statistical analysis already happened in Phase 3 (LogDataPage auto-detection). 
  So Phase 4 AnalyzerPage is about: Running the SplitIntoPackages() and SplitIntoSegments() algorithms
  Displaying the results (packages list, segments grid, raw hex/text views)

  This is different from what Document 06 shows. Let me confirm what IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING wants by checking the reference it mentions: "Doc 03 Section 5"

  ** after this you check document and summary below 

  Okay, so Document 03 doesn't have a "Section 5". The reference in IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING is wrong. Let me just proceed with what IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING Phase 4 describes: creating an AnalyzerPage that splits data into packages and segments using the detection configuration from Phase 3. The user wants me to move forward efficiently, so let me:
  Create a simple plan for Phase 4
  Start implementing the AnalyzerPage XAML layout (Phase 4.1-4.3)
  Create the PackageParser class (following encapsulation pattern)
  Implement the code-behind  

  ** then you start implementations

  ----------------
  
  But let me confirm that in log analysys process are we really do Analyze all statistical data to use in Analysis Page? 
  Let fully check and summaize it from both code and document and see is is match logical?

**** Q3

- Another thing i see i missing. When load log data file. Why i did not see any statistical data summary? 
  I want to see and check that from statistic data why you assume/use which terminator/delimeter/etc. 
  Also i what to see what Package type that you use after load log data file. So we need to show information 
  on Log Data Page.
