** Sample Log Data Files **
The example log data files (Capture from the Serial Monitor tools) is in @Documents\LuckyTex Devices folder with normally in format 
- HEX/Text 
- HEX Only 
- Text Only 


** Working C# project **
- Use .NET 4.7.2 Framework only (No .NET Core allow).
- Allow the Microsoft NuGet packages (Already in References folder)
- Current working project for Modern Implaments in in @09.App\NLib.Serial.Protocol.Analyzer project
  (i have v1 sub folder that is from previous implements do not access to this folder).


** Requirements **
- I want to load log data file in formats (HEX/Text, HEX Only, Text Only) to analyze protocol 
- When analyzer complete analyze protocols it shoud make protocol definition file to work with that serial device.
- When load definition to let say NTeminal<T> class where T is data class that shoud collcet data receive from serial ports and use definition file to extract data and update the T instance of values from serial ports. 
- We must have NDevice<T> class where T also same class we use in NTerminal<T> to emulate the device by set value in T instance and then the NDevice<T> can send package for terminal tool for verify correction. 

** Document Folder structore **
- let keep new generate document in @Documents\ModernDesign folder (that shoud already exist). Do not access to v1 sub folder (previous design).


** Exist production code **
check @01.Core/NLib.Serial.Devices/NLib.Serial.Devices.csproj for understanding what are production code work. Use code to check what we miss do not use it to design because it not flexible
