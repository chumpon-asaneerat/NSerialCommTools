Check @Prompts\NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md and there are some missing infor that you about to 
create documents but session end.

------------------------------

*** Note 1
During last session you create files (order by time you create)
1. WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-FINAL.md
2. WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-UPDATED.md
3. WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2.md

In last session I told you to merge these file beceuse you tend to create multiple file with no order instead of append exist file.
But the session already end before do anything 

------------------------------

*** Note 2
This is what you about todo but i interrupt before you done anything because immediately after you compact context 
you did not response my quesion to show summary what you understand but jump to execute the below task 

------------------------------

I'll continue from where we left off. Based on the previous session, I've reviewed the tracking documents and understand we need to implement the two-pass architecture refactor. Let me start with Phase 1: creating the models.
Update Todos

Create DetectionResult.cs model

Create TerminatorHierarchy.cs model

Update TerminatorInfo.cs with Type and Level properties

Create ProtocolDetector.cs class

Refactor TerminatorDetector.cs for hierarchy detection

Refactor MessageExtractor.cs to use DetectionResult

Update PatternAnalyzer.cs to use pre-detected patterns

Update MainWindow.xaml.cs pipeline

Test with JIK6CAB data and verify field splitting

------------------------------

*** Note 3: The is information during you compact context

------------------------------

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this extensive conversation about protocol analyzer refactoring:

## Message Flow Analysis:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked to check `@Prompts/last_session.txt` - I read and summarized the previous session's work on 2025-10-24, which included:
   - Revert of template changes
   - Property clarification (IsSkipped → ShowInEditor)
   - Empty line export fixes
   - Discovery of 4 critical architectural TODOs

2. **User chose option 1**: Update documentation to sync with code changes
   - I updated `04-Data-Models-Design.md` (removed ValidationRules, updated properties)
   - I updated `03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md` (removed Stage 6)

3. **User selected "continue next task"**: I recommended starting with TODO-004 (easiest quick win)

4. **User agreed ("ok")**: I implemented TODO-004 - Dynamic Unit Detection
   - Replaced hardcoded unit patterns with dynamic detection
   - Modified `RelationshipDetector.cs` with `IsCompoundFieldDynamic()` method

5. **User agreed to continue ("ok")**: I started TODO-003 - Encoding Detector
   - Created `EncodingDetector.cs` (440 lines)
   - Added BOM detection and pattern analysis
   - Integrated into `PatternAnalyzer.cs`, `FieldAnalyzer.cs`, `ProtocolDefinitionGenerator.cs`

6. **CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**: "before that it clean rebuild an run you code. The output is in @Prompts/JIK6CAB_Protocol.json check is the definition file can recreate protocol back"
   - User tested the code and found it produces same output as before
   - User identified that split relationships aren't being exported correctly
   - **IMPORTANT**: User then made critical observation: "from what i see you use regex to parse value so the last task will overwrite all code we work until now. Let dont check it now may be we should complete tasks first"
   - User advised to defer testing until after completing all refactors

7. **User agreed to continue ("ok")**: I started TODO-001/002 - Byte[] Processing
   - Created `ByteArraySplitter.cs` utility class
   - Updated `FieldAnalyzer.cs` to accept TerminatorInfo and use byte[] splitting
   - Updated `MessageExtractor.cs` to use byte[] splitting
   - Updated `PatternAnalyzer.cs` to pass terminator

8. **CRITICAL USER REQUEST**: "Let me confirm how it work show me detail process that start from you get filename until complete analyze i want to check your understanding"
   - I provided detailed pipeline flow from file loading through JSON export
   - User identified FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL FLAW

9. **USER'S CRITICAL FEEDBACK**: "I build and try code the result is same as previous code (before change to byte[]) but still has problem to split fields. let note that but i want to make adjustment before fix that problem. The logic that you show me i dont think it should be like that because you must analyze file first to find all message block terminator (if you want to make a quick check but if it can analyze each field terminator in one go is perfect). So your current code may be not properly extract another protocols correctly"
   - **KEY INSIGHT**: We're splitting BEFORE detecting terminators (wrong order!)
   - User correctly identified circular dependency problem

10. **I confirmed understanding**: "Yes that seem correct way for at least by logical view"
    - I proposed two-pass architecture: Detect → Split → Analyze

11. **USER REQUEST**: "let upadte work summary and create tracking todo file first. I afraid you will missing if not take note and session end"
    - Created `REFACTOR-TODO-Two-Pass-Architecture.md` (complete implementation plan)
    - Created `WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-UPDATED.md`
    - Created `NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md` (quick reference)

12. **USER FEEDBACK**: "Why you create multiple WORK-SUMMARY files if it in same session you should update exist file. But do it later i still feel you terminator category a bit weird. Now we work with byte[] right? It should has no concepts of line terminator right?. only field termitor are not enuogh?"
    - User pointed out I shouldn't create multiple summary files
    - **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: User questioned the "line terminator" concept
    - User suggested maybe only frame terminator and field terminator are needed

13. **I explained three-level hierarchy**: Frame → Line → Field
    - User challenged this

14. **USER CORRECTION**: "The Strategy B: State Machine (JIK6CAB) each line are not one field but it can be multiple fields"
    - I had misunderstood - each line can contain MULTIPLE fields
    - So three levels ARE needed: Frame → Segments → Fields

15. **CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**: "let do not use line work let use sub frame or another work instead. It will lead you to revert to think it as text that is wrong"
    - User correctly identified that "line" is a TEXT concept
    - We're working with byte[], not text
    - Terminology should be binary-first

16. **I proposed "segment"**: User approved ("Use segment sound nice let use it")
    - Final terminology: Frame → Segment → Field
    - All binary-first thinking, no text concepts

17. **Summary request**: User asked for detailed conversation summary

## Key Technical Decisions:
- Completed TODO-003 (Encoding Detector) and TODO-004 (Dynamic Units)
- Attempted TODO-001/002 but discovered architectural flaw
- Architecture must be: Detect (all terminators) → Split (using detected) → Analyze
- Terminology: Frame/Segment/Field (NOT line - binary-first thinking)

## User Feedback Patterns:
- User correctly identified circular dependency problem
- User emphasized "analyze first, split second"
- User corrected text-centric thinking ("line" → "segment")
- User advised deferring testing until architecture is fixed
- User requested thorough documentation before session ends

Summary:
## 1. Primary Request and Intent:

The user's primary requests evolved through the session:

1. **Initial**: Review previous session's work and continue with architectural debt reduction (4 critical TODOs)
2. **Documentation Sync**: Update documentation files to match code changes from previous session (remove ValidationRules, update properties)
3. **TODO-004**: Implement dynamic unit detection (remove hardcoded unit patterns)
4. **TODO-003**: Implement encoding detector (support UTF-8, UTF-16, international characters)
5. **TODO-001/002**: Implement byte[] processing throughout (binary-safe architecture)
6. **CRITICAL PIVOT**: After testing, user identified fundamental architectural flaw - code splits data BEFORE detecting terminators
7. **Architecture Redesign**: User requested proper two-pass architecture: "you must analyze file first to find all message block terminator"
8. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive tracking files before session ends to preserve work
9. **Terminology Correction**: User insisted on binary-first thinking - replace "line" with "segment" to avoid text-centric concepts

**User's Core Intent**: Fix protocol analyzer to work with ANY protocol by:
- Detecting patterns from data (not hardcoding)
- Using binary-safe byte[] processing throughout
- Analyzing FIRST to find terminators, then splitting (not the reverse)
- Thinking in binary terms (Frame→Segment→Field), not text terms

---

## 2. Key Technical Concepts:

- **Protocol Analyzer Architecture**: Tool to analyze serial device log files and generate JSON protocol definitions
- **Byte[] Processing**: Binary-safe data handling throughout pipeline (no premature string conversion)
- **Encoding Detection**: Auto-detect text encoding (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 LE/BE, UTF-32 LE/BE) using BOM detection and pattern analysis
- **Dynamic Pattern Detection**: Discover patterns from actual data instead of hardcoding assumptions
- **Terminator Hierarchy**: Three-level structure for protocol parsing:
  - **Frame Terminator**: Separates complete protocol messages (e.g., double CRLF, frame markers)
  - **Segment Terminator**: Separates segments within a frame (e.g., single CRLF in JIK6CAB) - NOT "line terminator" (text concept)
  - **Field Delimiter**: Separates fields within a segment (e.g., space, comma, tab)
- **Two-Pass Architecture** (proposed fix):
  - **Pass 1 (Detection)**: Analyze raw bytes to detect ALL terminators, encoding, markers
  - **Pass 2 (Extraction)**: Split using detected patterns (no guessing)
  - **Pass 3 (Analysis)**: Analyze structured data, generate JSON
- **Circular Dependency Problem**: Current code splits before detecting (MessageExtractor needs terminator but runs before TerminatorDetector)
- **Binary-First Thinking**: All operations on byte[], string conversion only for display/analysis
- **Data-Driven Design**: No hardcoded assumptions - discover everything from data
- **.NET Framework 4.7.2**: Target framework
- **BOM (Byte Order Mark)**: Special byte sequences indicating encoding (EF BB BF for UTF-8, etc.)
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scores for detection results

### Files Modified:

#### `Models\AnalysisResult.cs`
- **Why**: Store encoding detection results
- **Changes**:
```csharp
public class AnalysisResult
{
    // ... existing properties ...
    
    // NEW - Encoding detection results
    public System.Text.Encoding DetectedEncoding { get; set; }
    public string EncodingName { get; set; }
    public double EncodingConfidence { get; set; }
}
```

#### `Analyzers\PatternAnalyzer.cs`
- **Why**: Integrate encoding detection (Phase 0)
- **Changes**:
```csharp
public AnalysisResult Analyze(LogData logData)
{
    var result = new AnalysisResult { MessageCount = logData.MessageCount };
    
    // Phase 0: Encoding detection (NEW)
    if (logData.Messages.Count > 0)
    {
        var encodingInfo = _encodingDetector.DetectEncoding(logData.Messages[0]);
        result.DetectedEncoding = encodingInfo.Encoding;
        result.EncodingName = encodingInfo.EncodingName;
        result.EncodingConfidence = encodingInfo.Confidence;
    }
    
    // ... rest of analysis ...
}
```

#### `Analyzers\FieldAnalyzer.cs`
- **Why**: Use detected encoding and terminator for byte[] splitting
- **Changes**:
```csharp
// Updated signature
public List<FieldInfo> Analyze(LogData logData, DelimiterInfo delimiter, 
                                Encoding encoding = null, TerminatorInfo terminator = null)
{
    Encoding textEncoding = encoding ?? Encoding.ASCII;
    
    // Check multi-line using detected terminator
    bool isMultiLine = CheckIfMultiLine(logData, textEncoding, terminator);
    
    if (isMultiLine)
        return AnalyzeMultiLineFrames(logData, textEncoding, terminator);
    // ...
}

// Binary-safe splitting
private List<FieldInfo> AnalyzeMultiLineFrames(LogData logData, Encoding encoding, TerminatorInfo terminator)
{
    byte[][] terminatorBytes = GetTerminatorBytes(terminator, encoding);
    
    foreach (var message in logData.Messages)
    {
        // BINARY-SAFE: Split bytes by detected terminator
        List<byte[]> lineBytes = ByteArraySplitter.SplitByAny(message, terminatorBytes, ...);
        
        // Convert to string ONLY after splitting
        string[] lines = lineBytes.Select(bytes => encoding.GetString(bytes)).ToArray();
        
        // ... analyze fields ...
    }
}

private byte[][] GetTerminatorBytes(TerminatorInfo terminator, Encoding encoding)
{
    // Use detected terminator if confidence >= 0.8
    if (terminator != null && terminator.Bytes != null && terminator.Confidence >= 0.8)
        return new byte[][] { terminator.Bytes };
    
    // Fallback to common terminators
    return new byte[][]
    {
        encoding.GetBytes("\r\n"),
        encoding.GetBytes("\n"),
        encoding.GetBytes("\r")
    };
}
```

#### `Parsers\MessageExtractor.cs`
- **Why**: Accept terminator parameter and use byte[] splitting
- **Changes**:
```csharp
public LogData ExtractMessages(byte[] rawBytes, TerminatorInfo terminator = null, Encoding encoding = null)
{
    Encoding textEncoding = encoding ?? Encoding.ASCII;
    byte[][] terminatorBytes = GetTerminatorBytes(terminator, textEncoding);
    
    // BINARY-SAFE: Split bytes by terminator
    List<byte[]> lineBytes = ByteArraySplitter.SplitByAny(rawBytes, terminatorBytes, ...);
    
    // Convert to strings ONLY for marker detection
    string[] lines = lineBytes.Select(bytes => textEncoding.GetString(bytes)).ToArray();
    
    // ... rest of extraction ...
}
```

#### `Analyzers\ProtocolDefinitionGenerator.cs`
- **Why**: Export detected encoding to JSON
- **Changes**:
```csharp
private void GenerateMetadata(ProtocolDefinition definition, string deviceName, AnalysisResult analysis)
{
    definition.DeviceName = deviceName;
    definition.Version = "1.0";
    definition.GeneratedDate = DateTime.Now;
    
    // Use detected encoding (NEW)
    definition.Encoding = analysis.EncodingName ?? "ASCII";
    
    definition.Description = $"Auto-generated protocol definition for {definition.DeviceName}";
}
```

#### `Documents\ModernDesign\02-System-Architecture.md`
- **Why**: Mark TODO-003 and TODO-004 as complete
- **Changes**: Updated TODO sections to show completed status with implementation details

## 4. Errors and Fixes:

### Error 1: Architectural Flaw - Circular Dependency
- **Description**: Code splits data BEFORE detecting terminators
  - MessageExtractor runs first, needs to split by terminator
  - TerminatorDetector runs second, analyzes already-split data
  - MessageExtractor has to GUESS terminators (\r\n, \n, \r)
- **How Discovered**: User tested code after TODO-001/002 implementation and found same broken output
- **User Feedback**: "The logic that you show me i dont think it should be like that because you must analyze file first to find all message block terminator"
- **Root Cause**: Wrong order - should be Detect → Split, not Split → Detect
- **Fix Planned**: Two-pass architecture:
  - Pass 1: Detect all terminators from raw bytes
  - Pass 2: Split using detected terminators
  - Pass 3: Analyze structured data

### Error 2: Text-Centric Terminology
- **Description**: Using "line terminator" concept when working with byte[]
- **User Feedback**: "let do not use line work let use sub frame or another work instead. It will lead you to revert to think it as text that is wrong"
- **Why Wrong**: "Line" is a text concept, we're working with binary data
- **Fix Applied**: Changed terminology to binary-first thinking:
  - "Line terminator" → "Segment terminator"
  - "Line" → "Segment"
  - All operations on byte[], string only for display

### Error 3: Multiple Work Summary Files
- **Description**: Created both `WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-FINAL.md` and `WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-UPDATED.md`
- **User Feedback**: "Why you create multiple WORK-SUMMARY files if it in same session you should update exist file"
- **Fix Needed**: Consolidate into single summary file (deferred per user's "do it later")

### Error 4: Misunderstanding JIK6CAB Structure
- **Initial Understanding**: Each segment (line) is ONE field
- **User Correction**: "The Strategy B: State Machine (JIK6CAB) each line are not one field but it can be multiple fields"
- **Correct Understanding**: 
  - Frame → 10 segments (split by CRLF)
  - Each segment → multiple fields (split by space)
  - Example: "  0.00 kg" → 2 fields (value="0.00", unit="kg")
- **Fix Applied**: Updated architecture to three-level hierarchy: Frame → Segment → Field

### Error 5: Premature Implementation
- **Description**: Started implementing byte[] processing (TODO-001/002) without fixing architecture
- **User Feedback**: "from what i see you use regex to parse value so the last task will overwrite all code we work until now. Let dont check it now may be we should complete tasks first"
- **User Wisdom**: Defer testing until architecture is correct
- **Lesson**: Fix root cause (architecture) before adding features

---

## 5. Problem Solving:

### Problems Solved:

1. **TODO-004: Dynamic Unit Detection** ✅
   - Problem: Hardcoded unit patterns (only kg, g, pcs, °C, pH)
   - Solution: Generic regex pattern that detects ANY unit from data
   - Pattern: `^\s*([+-]?\d+\.?\d*)\s+([^\d\s][^\s]*)?\s*Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this extensive conversation about protocol analyzer refactoring:

## Message Flow Analysis:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked to check `@Prompts/last_session.txt` - I read and summarized the previous session's work on 2025-10-24, which included:
   - Revert of template changes
   - Property clarification (IsSkipped → ShowInEditor)
   - Empty line export fixes
   - Discovery of 4 critical architectural TODOs

2. **User chose option 1**: Update documentation to sync with code changes
   - I updated `04-Data-Models-Design.md` (removed ValidationRules, updated properties)
   - I updated `03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md` (removed Stage 6)

3. **User selected "continue next task"**: I recommended starting with TODO-004 (easiest quick win)

4. **User agreed ("ok")**: I implemented TODO-004 - Dynamic Unit Detection
   - Replaced hardcoded unit patterns with dynamic detection
   - Modified `RelationshipDetector.cs` with `IsCompoundFieldDynamic()` method

5. **User agreed to continue ("ok")**: I started TODO-003 - Encoding Detector
   - Created `EncodingDetector.cs` (440 lines)
   - Added BOM detection and pattern analysis
   - Integrated into `PatternAnalyzer.cs`, `FieldAnalyzer.cs`, `ProtocolDefinitionGenerator.cs`

6. **CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**: "before that it clean rebuild an run you code. The output is in @Prompts/JIK6CAB_Protocol.json check is the definition file can recreate protocol back"
   - User tested the code and found it produces same output as before
   - User identified that split relationships aren't being exported correctly
   - **IMPORTANT**: User then made critical observation: "from what i see you use regex to parse value so the last task will overwrite all code we work until now. Let dont check it now may be we should complete tasks first"
   - User advised to defer testing until after completing all refactors

7. **User agreed to continue ("ok")**: I started TODO-001/002 - Byte[] Processing
   - Created `ByteArraySplitter.cs` utility class
   - Updated `FieldAnalyzer.cs` to accept TerminatorInfo and use byte[] splitting
   - Updated `MessageExtractor.cs` to use byte[] splitting
   - Updated `PatternAnalyzer.cs` to pass terminator

8. **CRITICAL USER REQUEST**: "Let me confirm how it work show me detail process that start from you get filename until complete analyze i want to check your understanding"
   - I provided detailed pipeline flow from file loading through JSON export
   - User identified FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL FLAW

9. **USER'S CRITICAL FEEDBACK**: "I build and try code the result is same as previous code (before change to byte[]) but still has problem to split fields. let note that but i want to make adjustment before fix that problem. The logic that you show me i dont think it should be like that because you must analyze file first to find all message block terminator (if you want to make a quick check but if it can analyze each field terminator in one go is perfect). So your current code may be not properly extract another protocols correctly"
   - **KEY INSIGHT**: We're splitting BEFORE detecting terminators (wrong order!)
   - User correctly identified circular dependency problem

10. **I confirmed understanding**: "Yes that seem correct way for at least by logical view"
    - I proposed two-pass architecture: Detect → Split → Analyze

11. **USER REQUEST**: "let upadte work summary and create tracking todo file first. I afraid you will missing if not take note and session end"
    - Created `REFACTOR-TODO-Two-Pass-Architecture.md` (complete implementation plan)
    - Created `WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-24-Session-2-UPDATED.md`
    - Created `NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md` (quick reference)

12. **USER FEEDBACK**: "Why you create multiple WORK-SUMMARY files if it in same session you should update exist file. But do it later i still feel you terminator category a bit weird. Now we work with byte[] right? It should has no concepts of line terminator right?. only field termitor are not enuogh?"
    - User pointed out I shouldn't create multiple summary files
    - **CRITICAL CORRECTION**: User questioned the "line terminator" concept
    - User suggested maybe only frame terminator and field terminator are needed

13. **I explained three-level hierarchy**: Frame → Line → Field
    - User challenged this

14. **USER CORRECTION**: "The Strategy B: State Machine (JIK6CAB) each line are not one field but it can be multiple fields"
    - I had misunderstood - each line can contain MULTIPLE fields
    - So three levels ARE needed: Frame → Segments → Fields

15. **CRITICAL USER FEEDBACK**: "let do not use line work let use sub frame or another work instead. It will lead you to revert to think it as text that is wrong"
    - User correctly identified that "line" is a TEXT concept
    - We're working with byte[], not text
    - Terminology should be binary-first

16. **I proposed "segment"**: User approved ("Use segment sound nice let use it")
    - Final terminology: Frame → Segment → Field
    - All binary-first thinking, no text concepts

17. **Summary request**: User asked for detailed conversation summary

## Key Technical Decisions:
- Completed TODO-003 (Encoding Detector) and TODO-004 (Dynamic Units)
- Attempted TODO-001/002 but discovered architectural flaw
- Architecture must be: Detect (all terminators) → Split (using detected) → Analyze
- Terminology: Frame/Segment/Field (NOT line - binary-first thinking)

## User Feedback Patterns:
- User correctly identified circular dependency problem
- User emphasized "analyze first, split second"
- User corrected text-centric thinking ("line" → "segment")
- User advised deferring testing until architecture is fixed
- User requested thorough documentation before session ends

   - Validation: 80%+ match rate, 3+ samples, 1-5 unique units
   - Result: Works with lb, oz, mL, PSI, bar, custom units automatically

2. **TODO-003: Encoding Detection** ✅
   - Problem: Hardcoded ASCII assumption everywhere
   - Solution: EncodingDetector class with BOM detection and pattern analysis
   - Detects: ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 LE/BE, UTF-32 LE/BE
   - Confidence scoring: 1.0 for BOM, 0.95+ for pattern analysis
   - Result: Can handle international characters (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic)

3. **Documentation Sync** ✅
   - Problem: Docs out of sync with code (ValidationRules removed, properties changed)
   - Solution: Updated docs to v2.1 and v5.1 with correct information

### Ongoing Troubleshooting:

1. **Architectural Refactor - Two-Pass System** (BLOCKED - needs implementation)
   - Problem: Circular dependency (split before detect)
   - Current State: Architecture designed, documented, ready to implement
   - Blocking Issue: Cannot properly split fields until architecture is fixed
   - Next Steps: Implement in phases per `REFACTOR-TODO-Two-Pass-Architecture.md`

2. **Field Splitting Not Working** (BLOCKED by architecture)
   - Observed: JIK6CAB fields not splitting correctly
   - Root Cause: Wrong terminator detection order
   - Status: Deferred until two-pass architecture implemented

3. **Terminator Hierarchy Definition** (IN PROGRESS - terminology refined)
   - Challenge: Define proper levels for protocol parsing
   - Solution Evolved:
     - Level 1: Frame terminator (message boundaries)
     - Level 2: Segment terminator (chunks within frame) - NOT "line"
     - Level 3: Field delimiter (fields within segment)
   - Status: Terminology agreed upon, implementation pending

2. **Consolidate Work Summary Files** (user said "do it later")
   - Remove duplicate summary file
   - Keep single comprehensive version

3. **Verify All TODOs After Refactor**
   - Re-test TODO-003 (encoding detection)
   - Re-test TODO-004 (dynamic unit detection)
   - Verify byte[] processing is binary-safe
   - Verify terminators are detected, not guessed
   - Verify fields split correctly in JIK6CAB

## 8. Current Work:

**Immediately before summary request**, I was finalizing the terminology correction with the user regarding the three-level hierarchy for protocol parsing.

**Context**: After discovering the architectural flaw and creating documentation, the user challenged my use of "line terminator" as being too text-centric for binary data processing.

**Final Agreement Reached**:
```csharp
// Three-level hierarchy using binary-first terminology:
public class DetectionResult
{
    // Encoding (for display only, not splitting)
    public Encoding DetectedEncoding { get; set; }
    
    // Level 1: Frame boundaries (separates complete messages)
    public byte[] FrameTerminator { get; set; }
    
    // Level 2: Segment boundaries (chunks within frame) - NOT "line"
    public byte[] SegmentTerminator { get; set; }
    public bool HasSegmentStructure { get; set; }
    
    // Level 3: Field boundaries (data within segment)
    public byte[] FieldDelimiter { get; set; }
    public bool HasFieldDelimiter { get; set; }
    
    public ProtocolStructure Structure { get; set; }
}

public enum ProtocolStructure
{
    FlatDelimited,           // CSV: Frame only, split by delimiter
    SegmentedDelimited,      // JIK6CAB: Frame→Segments→Fields
    FlatFixedPosition,       // Frame only, fixed positions
    SegmentedFixedPosition,  // Frame→Segments, fixed positions
    Binary                   // Pure binary, no delimiters
}
```

**User's Quote Accepting This**: "Use segment sound nice let use it (sub frame is too long)"

**What Was Being Worked On**: Refining the data model for the two-pass architecture refactor, specifically correcting terminology from text-centric ("line") to binary-centric ("segment") concepts.

**Why This Matters**: The terminology directly affects how we think about the problem. "Line" implies text processing, while "segment" correctly represents binary data chunks. This correction prevents reverting to text-first thinking during implementation.

**JIK6CAB Example with Correct Terminology**:
```
byte[] rawBytes (5000 bytes)
  ↓ Split by FrameTerminator: [0x0D, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x0A] (double CRLF)
List<byte[]> frames (5 frames of ~120 bytes each)
  ↓ Split by SegmentTerminator: [0x0D, 0x0A] (single CRLF)
List<List<byte[]>> segments per frame (10 segments per frame)
  ↓ Split by FieldDelimiter: [0x20] (space)
List<List<List<byte[]>>> fields per segment per frame

Result for Frame 0:
  Segment 0: ["  0.00", "kg"]   ← 2 fields
  Segment 1: ["  1.94", "kg"]   ← 2 fields
  ...
  Segment 9: ["  1.94", "kg"]   ← 2 fields
```

## 9. Optional Next Step:

**DO NOT proceed with implementation yet** - the user requested a summary, which suggests they may be ending the session or need to review the current state.

**If continuing**, the next step would be:

**Phase 1 of Two-Pass Architecture Refactor**: Create the DetectionResult model

**Direct Quote from Most Recent Work**:
From my last response before summary: "Using 'segment' instead of 'line' keeps us in binary-first thinking: **Frame**: Complete message, **Segment/Sub-Frame**: Chunk within frame, **Field**: Data within segment. All splitting happens on `byte[]`, using byte patterns. String conversion only happens AFTER splitting for display/analysis."

**Specific Next Action**: Create `Models\DetectionResult.cs` with the agreed-upon structure:
```csharp
public class DetectionResult
{
    public Encoding DetectedEncoding { get; set; }
    public string EncodingName { get; set; }
    public double EncodingConfidence { get; set; }
    
    public byte[] FrameTerminator { get; set; }
    public double FrameTerminatorConfidence { get; set; }
    
    public byte[] SegmentTerminator { get; set; }
    public double SegmentTerminatorConfidence { get; set; }
    public bool HasSegmentStructure { get; set; }
    
    public byte[] FieldDelimiter { get; set; }
    public double FieldDelimiterConfidence { get; set; }
    public bool HasFieldDelimiter { get; set; }
    
    public ProtocolStructure Structure { get; set; }
    public double OverallConfidence { get; set; }
}
```

**However**, given that the user requested a summary, it's likely they want to pause here and review the comprehensive documentation that was created (`REFACTOR-TODO-Two-Pass-Architecture.md`, `NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md`) before proceeding with the refactor..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

------------------------------

*** Note 4

- This is from your last discussion with me to summary about my question 
Q: I still feel you terminator category a bit weird. Now we work with byte[] right? It should has no concepts of line terminator right?. only field termitor are not enuogh?

So final summary is 

Binary-First Mental Model
Three-Level Hierarchy:
Frame - Complete protocol message (one transmission cycle)
Segment - Chunk within a frame (NOT "line" - that's text-thinking)
Field - Individual data element within a segment
Key Principles:
Work with byte[] throughout the pipeline
Convert to string ONLY for display/analysis, NOT for splitting
Detect patterns from raw bytes BEFORE splitting
Use detected byte patterns for splitting (no guessing)
Architecture Flow:
Pass 1: DETECT
  Raw bytes → Analyze patterns → DetectionResult
  (Find frame terminator, segment terminator, field delimiter, encoding)

Pass 2: SPLIT  
  Raw bytes + DetectionResult → Split into structured data
  (Use detected patterns, no hardcoding)

Pass 3: ANALYZE
  Structured data → Generate protocol definition
JIK6CAB Example:
Frame terminator: [0x0D, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x0A] (double CRLF)
Segment terminator: [0x0D, 0x0A] (single CRLF)
Field delimiter: [0x20] (space)
Structure: Frame → 10 Segments → Multiple Fields per Segment
Current Problem:
Code splits BEFORE detecting (wrong order)
MessageExtractor guesses terminators instead of using detected ones
This causes field splitting to fail
