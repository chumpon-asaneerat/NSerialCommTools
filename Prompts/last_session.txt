Check WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-26-Session-4.md 

in last session i ask question 

----------------------------------------------
Q: read 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md and see Strategy Detection Pipeline are properly work as expect
----------------------------------------------


Your answer is 
----------------------------------------------

No, the Strategy Detection Pipeline is NOT working as expected. The current implementation has diverged from the design in critical ways:
Design says: "Look for special characters at start, extract patterns, analyze gaps"
Implementation does: "Find any repeating byte sequences with sliding window"
The design document (03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md) contains the correct algorithm that would work. The implementation just needs to follow it faithfully instead of trying a different approach. Would you like me to help implement the correct algorithm from the design document?

----------------------------------------------

let check @LuckyTex Devices folder i fixed example log data files. 
Let summary each example data result when use Strategy Detection Pipeline logic in document. 
Check that when use the logic for each example file what the result?
