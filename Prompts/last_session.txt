** CRITICAL: READ THESE DOCUMENTS FIRST BEFORE ANY WORK **

1. @Documents/ModernDesign/WORK-SUMMARY-2025-10-23.md - COMPLETE session summary with corrections
2. @Documents/ModernDesign/05-JSON-Schema-Design.md - See lines 1094-1183 for correct architecture
3. @Documents/ModernDesign/00-Requirements-Specification.md - Terminal/Device requirements

** ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS - DO NOT VIOLATE **

1. **NO TEMPLATES** - Terminal/Device work with individual field mappings ONLY
   - Terminal maps: field.name → dataClass.property (one-to-one)
   - Device outputs: fields sequentially by Order/Position
   - NO line templates, NO combining logic needed

2. **NO HARDCODING** - Must be data-driven for ANY protocol
   - NO switch/case on field types like "WeightKg", "Temperature"
   - Analyze actual sample data dynamically
   - Cannot assume protocols have specific field types

3. **NO v1 FOLDER ACCESS** - Old abandoned code/documents
   - ❌ 09.App\NLib.Serial.Protocol.Analyzer\v1\**
   - ❌ Documents\ModernDesign\v1\**

4. **FIELDS CAN SHARE SAME LINE** - This is the key understanding!
   Example: Line "  0.00 kg" has TWO fields:
   - TareWeight (position 3): parsePattern matches whole line, extracts number
   - TareUnit (position 4): parsePattern matches whole line, extracts unit
   Both fields parse from SAME line, map to DIFFERENT properties!

5. **FIELD NAMES MUST BE UNIQUE BY DEFAULT** - Critical for validation!
   - Analyzer doesn't know semantic meaning, so uses running numbers: Date1, Date2, WeightKg1, WeightKg2
   - Same datatype appears multiple times → needs unique names to avoid validation errors
   - User renames ONLY the fields they need to map to data class properties
   - Fields user doesn't need (markers, empty lines, reserved) keep default unique names
   - Example: WeightKg1, WeightKg2, WeightKg3, WeightKg4 (all same pattern, different lines)
   - User renames: WeightKg1→TareWeight, WeightKg2→GrossWeight, WeightKg3→NetWeight
   - WeightKg4 stays as-is (maybe duplicate display field, user doesn't need it)

** SESSION 2025-10-24 PART 1: REVERT TEMPLATE CHANGES **

✅ **SUCCESSFULLY REVERTED ALL WRONG CHANGES FROM 2025-10-23**

Fixed the Split relationship export bug by:
1. ✅ Removed Template property from FieldRelationship.cs
2. ✅ Removed GenerateLineTemplate() hardcoded method
3. ✅ Fixed ProtocolDefinitionGenerator.cs filter - now exports all relationships
4. ✅ Relationships are pure documentation/metadata

** SESSION 2025-10-24 PART 2: PROPERTY CLARIFICATION & FIXES **

## Deep Analysis of Properties

### **Q1: Field Names Don't Matter for Protocol Recreation** ✅ CONFIRMED

**User is 100% CORRECT!** Field names are irrelevant for protocol recreation:
- Terminal: parsePattern extracts data → stores in data[field.name]
- Device: reads data[field.name] → formats with formatString → outputs
- Mapping to data class is Terminal's config, not protocol definition's concern

Whether field is named "WeightKg1Value" or "TareWeight" - protocol recreates identically!

---

### **Q2: Missing Features Analysis**

**Found 3 properties that were misunderstood:**

#### **1. Action Property - CLARIFIED** ✅

**What it actually does:**
- NOT for Terminal/Device logic
- Used ONLY for UI filtering in Protocol Analyzer app
- `Action = "Skip"` meant "hide from UI editor"

**Values:**
- `"Parse"` = Extract data from protocol (for Terminal)
- `"Validate"` = Check value matches expected (for Terminal)
- `"Skip"` = **Hide from UI editor** (old usage, now replaced)

**Bug found:** Empty lines had `Action = "Skip"` which hid them from UI AND prevented export!

---

#### **2. Width Property - NOT NEEDED** ❌

**User is CORRECT!** Width is NOT needed for modern architecture:
- Only used in old v1 abandoned code
- Modern approach uses parsePattern (regex) not positional parsing
- Device reconstructs by formatting each field individually
- All exports show `width: 0` because analysis not implemented (and not needed!)

**Conclusion:** Width can stay 0 or be removed entirely

---

#### **3. ValidationRules - DOCUMENTATION ONLY** ✅

**User is CORRECT!** ValidationRules are auto-generated suggestions:
- Min/Max calculated from sample data with +10% buffer
- NOT enforced by Terminal/Device
- Purpose: Show developer "expected ranges" during development
- Actual production validation is in user's application code

**Conclusion:** Keep in JSON as reference, but user's validation is separate

---

## Major Fix: Renamed IsSkipped → ShowInEditor

**Problem:** `IsSkipped` property existed but was confusing and unused

**User's brilliant suggestion:** "Add property for UI to know which fields to display"

**Solution:** Rename `IsSkipped` → `ShowInEditor` for clarity!

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Models/FieldInfo.cs**
```csharp
// RENAMED property:
public bool ShowInEditor { get; set; }  // Was: IsSkipped

// Constructor default:
ShowInEditor = true;  // By default, show all fields
```

**Clear semantics:**
- `ShowInEditor = true` → Show in UI field editor (user can rename)
- `ShowInEditor = false` → Hide from UI (system field)

---

#### **2. Analyzers/FieldAnalyzer.cs (line 183-184)**

**Empty lines now correctly handled:**
```csharp
if (samples.All(s => string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(s)))
{
    fieldInfo.FieldType = "Empty";
    fieldInfo.Action = "Validate";      // ✅ Validate line is empty
    fieldInfo.ShowInEditor = false;     // ✅ Hide from UI
    fieldInfo.IncludeInDefinition = true;  // ✅ EXPORT to JSON!
}
```

**Before:** Action="Skip" → hidden from UI AND not exported ❌
**After:** Action="Validate" + ShowInEditor=false → exported but hidden ✅

---

#### **3. Analyzers/RelationshipDetector.cs (line 156-158)**

**Split parent fields now correctly handled:**
```csharp
// After splitting WeightKg1 → WeightKg1Value + WeightKg1Unit:
field.IncludeInDefinition = false;  // Don't export parent
field.ShowInEditor = false;         // Hide from UI
field.Action = "Parse";             // Keep for documentation
```

**Clear separation of concerns:**
- `IncludeInDefinition` = controls JSON export
- `ShowInEditor` = controls UI visibility
- `Action` = documents what field was used for

---

#### **4. MainWindow.xaml.cs (line 383, 401)**

**UI filtering updated:**
```csharp
// Analysis Results tab:
var activeFields = _currentAnalysis.Fields
    .Where(f => f.ShowInEditor)  // Was: f.Action != "Skip"
    .ToList();

// Field Editor tab:
_fields = _currentAnalysis.Fields
    .Where(f => f.ShowInEditor)  // Clear intent!
    .ToList();
```

---

## Behavior Matrix After Fix

| Field Type | Action | ShowInEditor | IncludeInDefinition | In JSON? | In UI? |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Empty line | Validate | ❌ false | ✅ true | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |
| Split parent | Parse | ❌ false | ❌ false | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| Split child (Value) | Parse | ✅ true | ✅ true | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Split child (Unit) | Validate | ✅ true | ✅ true | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Data field | Parse | ✅ true | ✅ true | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Marker | Validate | ✅ true | ✅ true | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |

---

## Files Modified in Session

1. ✅ `Models/FieldInfo.cs` - Renamed IsSkipped → ShowInEditor, added default
2. ✅ `Analyzers/FieldAnalyzer.cs` - Fixed empty lines: Action="Validate", ShowInEditor=false
3. ✅ `Analyzers/RelationshipDetector.cs` - Fixed split parents: ShowInEditor=false, Action="Parse"
4. ✅ `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Updated UI filtering to use ShowInEditor (2 locations)

---

## What This Fixes

✅ **Empty lines now export to JSON** (position counting works)
✅ **Empty lines hidden from UI editor** (user doesn't see Empty1, Empty2)
✅ **Split parent fields stay hidden** (user only sees Value+Unit children)
✅ **Clear separation of concerns** (ShowInEditor=UI, IncludeInDefinition=export, Action=logic)
✅ **Better code readability** (`if (field.ShowInEditor)` vs `if (field.Action != "Skip")`)

---

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Build Protocol Analyzer in Visual Studio
2. Load JIK6CAB log file
3. Verify Analysis Results tab shows child fields (not parents or empty lines)
4. Verify Field Editor shows only editable fields
5. Export to JSON
6. Verify JSON contains:
   - ✅ Empty fields (Empty1, Empty2)
   - ✅ Split child fields (WeightKg1Value, WeightKg1Unit)
   - ✅ Split relationships
   - ❌ Split parent fields (WeightKg1)

---

** REMEMBER **

- **ShowInEditor** = controls UI visibility only
- **IncludeInDefinition** = controls JSON export only
- **Action** = tells Terminal what to do (Parse/Validate)
- Field names don't affect protocol recreation - only property mapping
- Width property not needed for modern regex-based architecture
- ValidationRules are suggestions only, not enforced
