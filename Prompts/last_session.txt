** Check files
- 02-System-Architecture.md
- 03-Parsing-Strategy-Analysis.md
- 04-Data-Models-Design.md
- 05-JSON-Schema-Design.md
- 06-Protocol-Analyzer-Complete-UI.md

** Also keep in mind we must not assume to code using only JIK6CAB protocol but need to cover all protocols 
that analysis by applcation itself to create definition file that can work properly with terminal class 


Then Check @Prompts/JIK6CAB_Protocol.json are it generate correctly and ready to use in terminal 
but from what i see it still wrong.
