## Overview

### Purpose

This document analyzes the **real-world complexity** of serial device protocols found in `@Documents\LuckyTex Devices\` and defines comprehensive parsing strategies to handle all device types, including the most complex state machine protocols.

**Device Coverage**:
1. Simple single-line (CordDEFENDER3000, WeightQA)
2. Multi-line frames (TFO1)
3. **State machine sequential lines (JIK6CAB)** ‚≠ê MOST COMPLEX
4. Content-based multi-line (PHMeter)

### Key Challenge

**Different devices require fundamentally different parsing strategies**. The Protocol Analyzer must automatically detect which strategy to use through statistical, structural, and pattern analysis.
